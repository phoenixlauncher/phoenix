  ##

  This launcher was inspired by projects like Playnite and Lutris, and supports any game which can be launched from the command line!

  It was designed to be small, fast, and not overly complicated.

## Setup

To setup the app refer to [the setup page](./setup.md).

## Building

If you want to build this app for yourself, just download this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:PhoenixLauncher/Phoenix.git
```

then open `Phoenix.xcodeproj` in Xcode. You will first have to update the `Team` field in the `Signing and Capabilities` section of `Targets > Phoenix` in the main Project file. You can then create a `.app` file by going to `Product > Archive` in the menu bar, clicking `Distribute App`, selecting `Copy App` and then saving the folder somewhere easy to find like your desktop. The app will be inside the folder and you can copy it into your applications folder and begin using it!

## Updates

If you want to be notified when new updates are released here, make sure you "watch" this repository at the top of the page. You can be notified of only new releases by clicking the arrow next to the button, selecting "Custom", and then selecting "Releases" and then "Apply"
